| **Purpose**      | Optimization and search                                 | General-purpose problem-solving tool       |
| **Uses Bounds**  | Yes – to prune branches and improve efficiency          | No – it blindly explores all possibilities |
| **Backtracking** | Yes – guided by bounds                                  | Yes – often blind or rule-based            |
| **Efficiency**   | More efficient for optimization problems due to pruning | Can be inefficient without pruning         |
| **Example**      | Solving TSP with minimum cost                           | Calculating factorial or Fibonacci         |
