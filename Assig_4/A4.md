| **Purpose**      | Optimization and search                                 | General-purpose problem-solving tool       |
| **Uses Bounds**  | Yes – to prune branches and improve efficiency          | No – it blindly explores all possibilities |
| **Backtracking** | Yes – guided by bounds                                  | Yes – often blind or rule-based            |
| **Efficiency**   | More efficient for optimization problems due to pruning | Can be inefficient without pruning         |
| **Example**      | Solving TSP with minimum cost                           | Calculating factorial or Fibonacci         |

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Branch** | Try placing a queen in every column of current row |
| **Bound**  | Check column and diagonals using boolean arrays    |
| **Prune**  | Skip columns where queen would be under attack     |

## 🔹 1. Forward Checking

### ✅ **What is it?**

When a variable is assigned a value, forward checking **immediately eliminates inconsistent values** from the domains of unassigned variables.

### 🧠 **Goal:**

Prevent future conflicts early, right after assigning a value.

### 💡 **Example (4-Queens):**

* Assign $Q_1 = 2$ (queen in row 1, column 2)
* Remove column 2 and diagonals from domains of $Q_2, Q_3, Q_4$
* If any variable has an empty domain → backtrack early.

## 🔹 2. Backjumping

### ✅ **What is it?**

An improvement over backtracking: instead of going back to the **immediately previous variable**, backjumping **skips back to the most recent variable involved in the conflict**.

### 🧠 **Goal:**

Avoid unnecessary re-checks by "jumping" over unrelated assignments.

### 💡 **Example:**

* Suppose $Q_4$ has no valid position.
* Instead of just backtracking to $Q_3$, backjumping realizes the problem started with the assignment at $Q_1$, and jumps directly there.

## 🔹 3. Constraint Propagation

### ✅ **What is it?**

Constraint Propagation tries to **enforce local consistency** across variables to reduce the search space as much as possible before or during search.

### 🔁 **Most common technique:** **Arc Consistency (AC-3)**

### 🧠 **Goal:**

Continuously simplify the problem by removing values from domains that can’t possibly work based on constraints.

### 💡 **Example (AC-3):**

* If $Q_1$ is assigned a value, remove conflicting values from the domain of $Q_2$, and then check how that affects $Q_3$, and so on recursively.
