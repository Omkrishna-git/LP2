## âœ… Step 1: Check if Python is Installed

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python --version
```
or

```bash
python3 --version
```


## âœ… Step 2: Install `openpyxl`

Once Python is installed, open the terminal and run:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

If you're using `python3`, use:

```bash
pip3 install openpyxl
```

This will install `openpyxl`, which is used to read and write Excel `.xlsx` files in Python.

## âœ… Step 3: Verify Installation

To check if `openpyxl` is successfully installed, run:

```bash
python
```

Then in the Python shell:

```python
import openpyxl
print(openpyxl.__version__)
```

You should see the version number printed without any error.
