## üéØ Goal: Understand Manhattan Distance in A\* Algorithm

The **Manhattan Distance** for a tile is the number of moves it would take to get to its goal position, assuming only vertical and horizontal moves are allowed (no diagonals).  

### üìå Formula:

For a tile with value `v`,  
- Let its current position be `(row, col)`  
- Let its goal position be `(goalRow, goalCol)`  

Then:  
**`Manhattan distance for tile v = |row - goalRow| + |col - goalCol|`**

We compute this for each tile (except the blank tile `0`) and sum them up.

## Example

### Initial Puzzle State:
```
2 8 3
1 6 4
7 0 5
```

### Goal Puzzle State:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
```

Now, calculate the Manhattan distance **tile by tile**:

| Tile | Current Position | Goal Position | Calculation                             | Distance |
|------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1    | (1, 0)           | (0, 0)         | `|1 - 0| + |0 - 0|` = `1 + 0`             | 1        |
| 2    | (0, 0)           | (0, 1)         | `|0 - 0| + |0 - 1|` = `0 + 1`             | 1        |
| 3    | (0, 2)           | (0, 2)         | `|0 - 0| + |2 - 2|` = `0 + 0`             | 0        |
| 4    | (1, 2)           | (1, 0)         | `|1 - 1| + |2 - 0|` = `0 + 2`             | 2        |
| 5    | (2, 2)           | (1, 1)         | `|2 - 1| + |2 - 1|` = `1 + 1`             | 2        |
| 6    | (1, 1)           | (1, 2)         | `|1 - 1| + |1 - 2|` = `0 + 1`             | 1        |
| 7    | (2, 0)           | (2, 0)         | `|2 - 2| + |0 - 0|` = `0 + 0`             | 0        |
| 8    | (0, 1)           | (2, 1)         | `|0 - 2| + |1 - 1|` = `2 + 0`             | 2        |

**Tile 0 is ignored** in this calculation because it‚Äôs just the empty space.

---

## Final Manhattan Distance (h-value)

```
1 (tile 1)
+ 1 (tile 2)
+ 0 (tile 3)
+ 2 (tile 4)
+ 2 (tile 5)
+ 1 (tile 6)
+ 0 (tile 7)
+ 2 (tile 8)
= **9**
```

So the heuristic function will return `h = 9` for this state.

‚úÖ g(n) = number of moves made so far


‚úÖ Heuristic Function Used
Manhattan Distance:
For each tile, calculate |current_row - goal_row| + |current_col - goal_col|

Add for all tiles (except the blank)

This estimates how many moves a tile is away from where it should be.



üåü A* Search Overview
A* uses the formula:
Copy
Edit
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
Where:

g(n) = cost from the start state to current state n (i.e., number of moves so far)

h(n) = heuristic estimate from current state to goal

‚úÖ Heuristic Function Used
üìè Manhattan Distance:
For each tile, calculate |current_row - goal_row| + |current_col - goal_col|

Add for all tiles (except the blank)

This estimates how many moves a tile is away from where it should be.

üîç Step 1: Calculate h(n) for Initial State
Manhattan Distance:
Tile 8: current position (2,2), goal position (2,1) ‚Üí |2-2| + 1

All other tiles are in correct position ‚Üí 0 distance

So:

g(n) = 0 (no moves yet)

h(n) = 1

f(n) = 0 + 1 = 1

üîÅ Step : Generate Children (Valid Moves)
Blank is at (2,1). Valid moves: Left, Up, Right

Move 1: Blank ‚Üê Left (swap _ with 7)

1 2 3
4 5 6
_ 7 8
g(n) = 1
h(n) = 2 (tiles 7 and 8 are 1 move away)
f(n) = 1 + 2 = 3

Move 2: Blank ‚Üë Up (swap _ with 5)

1 2 3
4 _ 6
7 5 8

Tile 5: (2,1) ‚Üí (1,1) ‚Üí |2-1| + |1-1| = 1
Tile 8: (2,2) ‚Üí (2,1) ‚Üí |2-2| + |2-1| = 1
h(n) = 2, g(n) = 1, f(n) = 3

Move 3: Blank ‚Üí Right (swap _ with 8) ‚Üí Goal

All tiles are correct

h(n) = 0, g(n) = 1, f(n) = 1

‚úÖ Found the goal in just 1 move.

üìå How A* Search Works Here
Insert initial state into a priority queue based on f(n)

While the queue is not empty:

Pop the state with lowest f(n)

If it's the goal, stop

Else, generate valid moves, calculate f(n) for each child, and insert them into the queue

The goal was found with minimum cost using A* efficiently.

‚úÖ Why A* is Powerful
Uses actual + estimated cost ‚Üí balanced and smart

If h(n) is admissible (never overestimates), A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path

In 8-puzzle, good heuristics make A* much faster than DFS/BFS
