## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Understand Manhattan Distance in A\* Algorithm

The **Manhattan Distance** for a tile is the number of moves it would take to get to its goal position, assuming only vertical and horizontal moves are allowed (no diagonals).  

### ðŸ“Œ Formula:

For a tile with value `v`,  
- Let its current position be `(row, col)`  
- Let its goal position be `(goalRow, goalCol)`  

Then:  
**`Manhattan distance for tile v = |row - goalRow| + |col - goalCol|`**

We compute this for each tile (except the blank tile `0`) and sum them up.

## Example

### Initial Puzzle State:
```
2 8 3
1 6 4
7 0 5
```

### Goal Puzzle State:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
```

Now, calculate the Manhattan distance **tile by tile**:

| Tile | Current Position | Goal Position | Calculation                             | Distance |
|------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1    | (1, 0)           | (0, 0)         | `|1 - 0| + |0 - 0|` = `1 + 0`             | 1        |
| 2    | (0, 0)           | (0, 1)         | `|0 - 0| + |0 - 1|` = `0 + 1`             | 1        |
| 3    | (0, 2)           | (0, 2)         | `|0 - 0| + |2 - 2|` = `0 + 0`             | 0        |
| 4    | (1, 2)           | (1, 0)         | `|1 - 1| + |2 - 0|` = `0 + 2`             | 2        |
| 5    | (2, 2)           | (1, 1)         | `|2 - 1| + |2 - 1|` = `1 + 1`             | 2        |
| 6    | (1, 1)           | (1, 2)         | `|1 - 1| + |1 - 2|` = `0 + 1`             | 1        |
| 7    | (2, 0)           | (2, 0)         | `|2 - 2| + |0 - 0|` = `0 + 0`             | 0        |
| 8    | (0, 1)           | (2, 1)         | `|0 - 2| + |1 - 1|` = `2 + 0`             | 2        |

**Tile 0 is ignored** in this calculation because itâ€™s just the empty space.

## Final Manhattan Distance (h-value)

```
1 (tile 1)
+ 1 (tile 2)
+ 0 (tile 3)
+ 2 (tile 4)
+ 2 (tile 5)
+ 1 (tile 6)
+ 0 (tile 7)
+ 2 (tile 8)
= **9**
```

So the heuristic function will return `h = 9` for this state.

Would you like me to show the exact code line that performs this for a tile in your program?
